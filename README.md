# Keyboard

This is a simple web application that displays the key pressed by the user along with its keycode. It's a basic demonstration of capturing key events in the browser using JavaScript.


The JavaScript code in this project listens for keyup events and displays the pressed key's name and keycode.

Here's how it works:

-When a key is pressed and released, the keyup event is triggered.

-The JavaScript code captures the event and extracts the key's name using event.key.

-The keycode is extracted using event.keyCode.

-The captured information is then displayed on the webpage.
